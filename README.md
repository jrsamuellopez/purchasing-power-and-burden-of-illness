# Power purchasing of common goods, income and burden of illness
The relation between the burden of illness and the purchasing power in major cities around the world.

In this project, as a proof of concept, I analyze the prevalence of 169 different diseases and injuries (i.e., illness) based on how many products of a kind the people can buy and the average net salary (after tax) in a given city. I also explore the potential costs of the top 20 most expensive illness and how much money can be saved by modifying the prices of common products.

The file "Interactive..." includes a longer description, examples and the dashboard to test it by yourself as a WebApp.
