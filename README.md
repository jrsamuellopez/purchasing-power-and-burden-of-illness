In this project, as a proof of concept, I analyze the prevalence of 169 different diseases and injuries (i.e., illness) based on how many products of a kind the people can buy and the average net salary (after tax) in a given city. I also explore the potential costs of the top 20 most expensive illness and how much money can be saved by modifying the prices of common products.

The file "Interactive..." includes a longer description, examples and the dashboard to test it by yourself as a WebApp.
